CONVERSION OF THE SERIES B CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK</B></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">On December 16,
2015, the Board of Directors of Corning Natural Gas Holding Corporation (the &#8220;Holding Company&#8221;, and together with its
subsidiaries, the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;we&#8221; or &#8220;us&#8221;) declared a dividend of one subscription right for
each share of common stock outstanding as of the record date of April 14, 2016. Each non-transferable subscription right entitles
the holder to purchase either: (i) one-eighth share of our 6% Series A Cumulative Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, for
$25.00 per share (&#8220;Series A Cumulative Stock&#8221;), <U>or</U> (ii) one-sixth share of our 4.8% Series B Convertible Preferred
Stock, par value $0.01 per share, for $20.75 per share, each of which is convertible in accordance with its terms into one share
of our common stock, subject to adjustment (&#8220;Series B Convertible Stock&#8221;; and, together with the Series A Cumulative
Stock, the &#8220;Preferred Stock&#8221;). Each subscription right must be exercised, if at all, prior to June 20, 2016. No fractional
shares of Preferred Stock will be issued. A shareholder must hold eight subscription rights to subscribe for one share of Series
A Cumulative Stock or six subscription rights to subscribe for one share of Series B Convertible Stock.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">The subscription
rights will be issued as book entry securities on April 19, 2016 and will expire on June 20, 2016 if not exercised prior to that
date, unless we extend that date in our sole discretion. Based on the 2,469,871 shares of our common stock outstanding as of the
April 14, 2016 record date, we will issue 2,469,871 subscription rights. We currently have authorized, by amendment to our Certificate
of Incorporation, 140,000 shares of our Series A Cumulative Preferred Stock and 360,000 shares of our Series B Convertible Preferred
Stock. If shareholders exercise their rights to subscribe for shares of our Series A Cumulative Stock in excess of the 140,000
shares currently authorized, we will allocate the authorized shares pro rata among the shareholders subscribing for the Series
A Cumulative Stock. If shareholders exercise their rights to subscribe for shares of our Series B Convertible Stock in excess of
the 360,000 shares currently authorized, we will allocate the authorized shares pro rata among the shareholders subscribing for
the Series B Convertible Stock. The number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of each shares of Series B Convertible
Stock is subject to adjustment under certain circumstances. We cannot predict the extent to which our shareholders will exercise
their subscription rights, which are non-transferable, nor whether the shareholders who exercise the subscription rights will elect
to purchase Series A Cumulative Stock or Series B Convertible Stock. Because we have no commitments from shareholders to exercise
their subscription rights, it is possible we will not receive any proceeds from this offering.</P>

be issued any subscription rights unless you are a shareholder of record as of 5:00&nbsp;p.m. New York City time on April 14,
2016, which is the record date for the dividend of the rights. Your subscription rights will expire if they are not exercised
by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on June 20, 2016, the expected expiration date of this rights offering. We may extend the
period for exercising the subscription rights, in our sole discretion. If we extend the time for exercising the subscription
rights, we will not extend such time more than 30 days past the original expiration date. Subscription rights that are not
exercised by the expiration date of the rights offering will expire and will have no value. You should carefully consider
whether or not to exercise your subscription rights before the expiration date.</P>

prices without retail mark-up or mark-down or commission and may not necessarily represent actual transactions. The subscription
rights are not transferable. The shares of Series A Cumulative Stock and Series B Convertible Stock which may be issued on exercise
of the rights will not be listed for trading on any stock exchange or market. The Preferred Stock may be illiquid as we cannot
predict whether any trading market will develop for either the Series A Cumulative Stock or the Series B Convertible Stock.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt 2in; text-align: justify"><I>Overview</I></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt 2in; text-align: justify">We are a public utility company
holding company headquartered in Corning, New York, incorporated in 2013. Our principal subsidiary is the Gas Company, a regulated
natural gas distribution company with operations in New York, which was incorporated in 1904.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt 2in; text-align: justify">The Gas Company purchases,
transports, distributes and sells natural gas. The Gas Company has over 425 miles of gas distribution main, 15,000 services,
and 86 regulating stations. Our customer base includes residential, commercial, industrial and municipal customers in the
Southern Tier area of New York and gas utilities that service the Bath area and Elmira, New York. The Gas Company is
franchised to supply gas service in all of the political subdivisions in which it operates. The Gas Company also transports
and compresses gas for a gas producer from its gathering network into an interstate pipeline. The Gas Company is under the
jurisdiction of the NYPSC, which oversees and sets the rates for New York gas distribution companies.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt 2in; text-align: justify">Our largest customers are Corning
Incorporated, New York State Electric &amp; Gas, Bath Electric, Gas &amp; Water Systems, and Repsol Energy North America (formerly
Talisman Energy USA Incorporated). Although Repsol is a significant customer, unlike our other customers, we do not deliver gas
to Repsol. Rather, we receive gas from several of its gathering systems and wells and transport its gas through our system. These
customers accounted for approximately 18.8% of our revenues in fiscal year 2015 and 17.7% in fiscal year 2014.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt 2in; text-align: justify">We have contracted with various
sources to provide natural gas to our distribution system. We contract for pipeline capacity, as well as storage capacity of approximately
736,000 dekatherms (&#8220;Dth&#8221;). Prior to 2014, the Gas Company contracted with a third party to manage its gas supply and
storage. After that date, we began to manage our transportation and storage capacity with internal resources.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt 2in; text-align: justify">We have secured the NYPSC-required
fixed price and storage gas supply for the 2015-2016 winter season and are managing our storage and gas supply contracts to assure
that we follow our gas supply and acquisition plan. Assuming no extraordinary conditions for the winter season, gas supply, flowing
and storage, will be adequate to serve our approximately 15,000 customers.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt 2in; text-align: justify">Our business is highly seasonal
because a material portion of our total sales and delivery volumes is to customers whose usage varies depending upon temperature.
Our present rate structure, however, includes both a weather normalization clause and a revenue decoupling mechanism that are designed
to mitigate the effect of departures from normal temperatures on both our earnings and cost to our customers.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt 2in; text-align: justify">Our utility operations are subject
to regulation by the New York Public Service Commission, or the NYPSC, as to rates, service area, adequacy of service and safety
standards.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt 2in; text-align: justify">We also own a 50% interest in two
joint ventures with Mirabito Regulated Industries, LLC: Leatherstocking Gas Company, LLC and Leatherstocking Pipeline Company,
LLC, which we sometimes collectively refer to as the Leatherstocking JVs. The businesses of our Leatherstocking JVs require capital
to secure franchises and build pipelines and our agreements with the co-owner of the Leatherstocking JVs require that we match,
on a one-for-one basis, the contributions of capital made by Mirabito Regulated Industries, LLC. Leatherstocking Gas distributes
gas in Susquehanna and Bradford Counties, Pennsylvania, and has franchises to provide gas distribution services in Broome, Chenango,
Delaware, and Ostego Counties, New York. Leatherstocking Pipeline currently supplies gas from the Williams Partners L.P.&#8217;s
Laser pipeline to one customer in Lawton, Pennsylvania. Leatherstocking Gas owns three gate stations and approximately 16 miles
of pipeline in Susquehanna and Bradford counties, Pennsylvania.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt 2in; text-align: justify"><I>Recent Industry Trends</I></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt 2in; text-align: justify">Since 2000, domestic energy markets
have experienced significant price volatility. Natural gas markets have been particularly volatile, principally due to weather
and changes in supply availability. Rising natural gas prices and the development of new technologies (specifically, hydraulic
fracturing) have resulted in a surge in supply-related investment that has increased domestic production. In part as a result of
the significant increase in domestic supply, gas prices have fallen significantly. Historically, the competition in our residential
market has been primarily from electricity for cooking, water heating and clothes drying, and to a small degree, electricity, fuel
oil and propane for heating. The price of gas remains low in comparison to that of alternative fuels in the Gas Company&#8217;s
service territory and our competitive position in the residential, commercial and industrial markets continues to be strong. Over
90 percent of our residential customers heat with gas. When we expand our distribution system to attract new customers, our principal
competition is oil and propane. Natural gas enjoys a price advantage over these fuels today.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt 2in; text-align: justify">In addition, increasing supplies
and price induced conservation have favorably impacted natural gas prices. Given the current environment, we expect that natural
gas will maintain a favorable competitive position compared to other fuels. Given natural gas&#8217;s clean burning attributes,
we believe environmental regulations may enhance this competitive outlook.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt 2in; text-align: justify">Further, we do not expect a shortage
of natural gas to impact our business over the next five to ten years. Natural gas supply over the last several years has been
positive, and domestic reserves and production have increased. This is especially true in proximity to our distribution network.
We likewise anticipate no shortages of the necessary pipes and valves for safe distribution of natural gas, and continue to receive
material inventory from various reliable sources.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt 2in; text-align: justify"><I>Our Operating and Growth Strategy</I></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt 2in; text-align: justify">We intend to enhance shareholder
value through revenue growth and reduction of our operating costs. As a gas utility, the Gas Company&#8217;s earnings are primarily
determined by a rate of return set by the NYPSC on the investments in our facilities and equipment (<I>e.g.</I>, our rate base)
to ensure service to our customers. Over the next several years, we intend to continue making significant capital investments to
ensure the safety and reliability of our gas network. Based on these capital investments, we anticipate that we will increase our
rate base. In addition, we have identified growth opportunities that we believe will contribute to our revenues, earnings and rate
base, including growth in our existing service territory, expansion into new areas and increased connections with local production
sources.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt 2in; text-align: justify">We also invest in our joint ventures,
each a 50%-owned subsidiary, Leatherstocking Gas Company, LLC and Leatherstocking Pipeline Company, LLC. Leatherstocking Gas distributes
gas in Susquehanna and Bradford Counties, Pennsylvania, and has franchises to provide gas distribution services in Broome, Chenango,
Delaware, and Ostego Counties, New York. Leatherstocking Pipeline currently supplies gas from the Williams Partners L.P.&#8217;s
Laser pipeline to one customer in Lawton, Pennsylvania.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt 140pt; text-align: justify">We are distributing non-transferable
subscription rights to holders of our common stock, as a dividend, at no charge, at the rate of one right for each share of common
stock owned as of 5:00 p.m. on the record date for the dividend of April 14, 2016, for a total of 2,469,871 subscription right.
There is no minimum amount of proceeds required to complete the rights offering.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt 140pt; text-align: justify">Each right entitles the recipient
shareholder with the right to purchase either: (i)&nbsp;one-eighth share of our 6% Series A Cumulative Preferred Stock for $25.00,
or (ii) one-sixth share of our Series B Convertible Preferred Stock for $20.75. No fractional shares of Preferred Stock will be
issued. A shareholder must hold eight subscription rights to subscribe for one share of Series A Cumulative Stock or six subscription
rights to subscribe for one share of Series B Convertible Stock. For example, a stockholder with 1,000 shares of common stock will
receive 1,000 subscription rights and may purchase 125 shares of Series A Cumulative Preferred Stock for $3,125, or 166 shares
of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock for $3,444.50, or some combination of Series A and Series B Preferred Stock.</P>

transferable. The Series A and Series B Preferred Stock have not been issued or traded prior to this offering and will not be listed
on any exchange. No trading market may develop for the Preferred Stock. If the total subscriptions for Series A Cumulative Preferred
Stock exceed 140,000 shares, or for Series B Convertible Preferred Stock exceed 360,000, we will allocate shares of the applicable
series of Preferred Stock pro rata among the shareholders exercising their basic subscription rights for such series of Preferred
Stock.</P>

exercising basic subscription rights will first be allocated the authorized shares of the series of Preferred Stock for which they

is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service, or the courts and accordingly, it is possible that the Internal Revenue Service
could challenge this position. You may be required to allocate a portion of your tax basis in your common stock to the subscription

particular tax consequences resulting from the receipt and the disposition or exercise of subscription rights and the receipt,

Section 70 of the Public Service Law to permit holders of the Gas Company&#8217;s common stock to exercise subscription rights
equal to such holders&#8217; percentage ownership of common stock, without having to seek separate, individual authorization (<I>e.g</I>.,
a holder owning or deemed to own 12% of the common stock of the Gas Company could subscribe for up to 12% of the shares offering
in a rights offering available to all common shareholders, without the need for review by the NYPSC of the specific transaction).
Although that interpretation was limited to the circumstances pertaining to the particular prior subscription rights offering,
those circumstances are similar to the current rights offering. Accordingly, the Holding Company intends to request a determination
from the NYPSC that the conversion of the shares of Class B Convertible Stock into common stock, in proportion to existing ownership
interests, either does not require separate, individual authorization or, alternatively, if such authorization is required, that
it be granted.</P>

Stock authorized under our certificate of incorporation, as amended, shareholders may subscribe for more shares of either series
of Preferred Stock than we can issue. If more shares of either series of preferred stock are subscribed for, we will allocate the
authorized shares of that series to the subscribing shareholders pro rata. For example, if shareholders exercise their basic subscription
rights to purchase 150,000 shares of Series A Cumulative Stock, a shareholder exercising rights to purchase 100 shares of Series
A Cumulative Stock for an aggregate exercise price of $2,500.00, would receive 93 shares of Series A Cumulative Stock and a return
of the balance of the exercise price equal to $175.00. Fractional shares which would result from a pro ration will not be issued

130,000 shares of Series A Cumulative Stock (fewer than the 140,000 shares authorized) and some shareholders exercise over-subscription
rights to purchase an addition 15,000 shares, the shareholders exercising their basic subscription rights would be entitled to
purchase the full number of shares of Series A Cumulative Stock subscribed for, and the shareholders exercising their over-subscription
rights would each be able to purchase 2/3rds of the number of shares of Series A Cumulative Stock subscribed for upon exercise
of over-subscription rights. The same procedure will be used to pro rate any subscriptions for Series B Convertible Stock over

Under Section 70 of the NY Public Service Law, holders of more than 10% of our common stock, whether individuals or other entities,

Company. That requirement has been construed to apply to the shares of the corporate owner of a gas corporation such as the Holding

hold more than 10% after the offering is subscribed. Pursuant to this requirement, current or prospective holders of more than
10% of our common stock may subscribe to purchase Preferred Stock in this offering without further consent of the NYPSC; but the
conversion of Series B Convertible Stock into common stock could trigger the need for approval by the NYPSC. The Holding Company

<P STYLE="font: 12pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: center"><B>RISK FACTORS</B></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify"><I>An investment in our preferred stock
through exercise of any subscription rights involves significant risk. You should consider carefully, in addition to the other
information contained in this prospectus, in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, and our
other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the following risk factors before making any decision.</I></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: left"><B>Risks Related to Ownership of Our Preferred
Stock</B></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify"><B><I>It is unlikely there will be a
trading market in our preferred stock, accordingly, if you elect to exercise your subscription rights and purchase shares of either
of our series of preferred stock you may need to hold the shares indefinitely.</I></B></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">Even if all of the
subscription rights we issue are exercised, which is unlikely, there will be a small number of shares of our 6% Series A Cumulative
Preferred Stock (the &#8220;Series A Cumulative Stock&#8221;) and our Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (the &#8220;Series B
Convertible Stock&#8221;) outstanding. Both series of our preferred stock are new issues of securities with no established trading
market. We do not intend to apply to list our preferred stock on any securities exchange or to arrange for quotation on any automated
dealer quotation system. If all of the subscription rights were exercised and all shareholders purchased our Series A Cumulative
Stock, 140,000 shares would be outstanding. If all of the subscription rights were exercised and all shareholders purchased Series
B Convertible Stock, 360,000 shares would be outstanding. As a result, it is unlikely that a trading market will develop for either
series of preferred stock and likely that shareholders purchasing those shares will need to hold them indefinitely or, with respect
to the Series B Convertible Stock, convert the shares to common stock in order to dispose of their investment. Even if a trading
market for the preferred stock does develop, we cannot assure you of the depth or liquidity of that market, the ability of the
holders to sell the preferred stock, or the ability of the holders to sell the preferred stock at a favorable price. In addition,
any shares of preferred stock that are purchased by our directors and officers that are our affiliates will not be freely tradable
by such affiliates under U.S. securities laws, and as a result, the exercise by such affiliates or their subscription rights to
purchase shares of preferred stock would further reduce the depth and/or liquidity for any market that may develop for the preferred
stock.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify"><B><I>If you exercise your subscription
rights to purchase our Series B Convertible Stock, and elect to convert that stock into common stock, you will bear the risk of
a decline in the market price of our common stock prior to the conversion settlement date.</I></B></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">The aggregate market
value of the shares of our common stock that you would receive upon any conversion of shares of our Series B Convertible Stock
may be less than the aggregate liquidation preference of your shares of Series B Convertible Stock and less than the conversion
price. Specifically, if the applicable market value of our common stock is less than the initial price of $20.75 per share, subject
to certain anti-dilution adjustments, the market value of the shares of our common stock that you would receive upon conversion
of each share of our Series B Convertible Stock will be less than the $20.75 liquidation preference, resulting in a loss. Accordingly,
you will bear the entire risk of a decline in the market price of our common stock. Any such decline could be substantial.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify"><B><I>Upon conversion of the Series
B Convertible Stock for our common stock, because of the limited trading in our common stock, you may not be able to sell the common
stock at once or for some period of time, so the value of shares of our common stock may decline before you are able to sell.</I></B></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">The last sale price
of our common stock on the OTCQX<SUP>&reg;</SUP> on March 28, 2016, was $15.95 per share. Trading is infrequent with the three
month average volume reported as under 300 shares as of March 28, 2016. Accordingly, if the market price of shares of our common
stock decreases during this period, the value of the shares that you receive will be adversely affected and will be less than the
conversion value of the Series B Convertible Stock on the conversion date.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">We expect that,
if any trading market develops for our Series B Convertible Stock, the market price of our common stock will affect the market
price of our Series B Convertible Stock. This may result in greater volatility in the market price of the Series B Convertible
Stock than would be expected for nonconvertible preferred stock. The market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly
for many reasons, including in response to the risks described in this section, elsewhere in this prospectus or in the documents
we have incorporated by reference in this prospectus supplement or for reasons unrelated to our operations, such as market overhang
from the significant concentration of ownership of our common stock by funds which may sell for reasons unrelated to our business,
a thin trading market affected by selling pressure, reports by industry analysts, investor perceptions or negative announcements
by our customers, competitors or suppliers regarding their own performance, as well as industry conditions and general financial,
economic and political instability.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">We expect that the
market price of the Series A Cumulative Stock and the Series B Convertible Stock will be influenced by yield and interest rates
in the capital markets. Fluctuations in interest rates may provide investors with alternative investments with more attractive
yields. On December 16, 2015, the Federal Reserve announced the first small increase in certain key rates in nearly a decade. We
cannot predict the effect of that action on interest rates generally or on the market for preferred stocks or whether or when the
Federal Reserve may make further interest rate adjustments.</P>

of Section 70 of the New York Public Service Law to limit the ability of the holders of the common stock of the Holding Company

be required for holders who own, or would on conversion of their shares of Series B Convertible Stock, own 10% or more of the common

is a holding company with no material assets. In the event of a bankruptcy or liquidation, our assets will be available to make
payments of the liquidation preference to holders of our preferred stock only after all of our liabilities have been paid. In addition,
our preferred stock ranks structurally junior to all existing and future liabilities of our subsidiary the Gas Company and the
Leatherstocking JVs and the interests of any creditors holding pledges of our interests in such entities. Your rights to participate
in the assets of our subsidiaries upon any liquidation or reorganization of any subsidiary will rank junior to the prior claims
of that entity&#8217;s creditors and third party equity pledgees. In the event of a bankruptcy or liquidation, there may not be
sufficient assets remaining after paying those liabilities, to pay any amounts to the holders of our preferred stock then outstanding.
The Gas Company had outstanding approximately $26.2 million of secured debt at December 31, 2015, and the Leatherstocking JVs had
approximately $6.54 million of secured debt at December 31, 2015. The Holding Company has no debt at the parent level.</P>

New York law, our board of directors, or an authorized committee thereof, may declare dividends on our capital to the extent that
the Holding Company is not then insolvent, or would not be made insolvent by such redemption, and only to the extent of our statutory
&#8220;surplus&#8221;, which is defined as the amount equal to our net assets (total assets minus total liabilities minus our stated
capital (basically, the par value of our issued capital stock)), or if there is no such surplus, out of our net profits for the

Stock on its redemption date of September 30, 2023, to redeem the Series B Convertible Stock on its redemption date of September

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">The conversion rate
of our Series B Convertible Stock is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances, including the payment of certain cash dividends.
If, for example, the conversion rate is adjusted as a result of a distribution that is taxable to our common shareholders, such
as a cash dividend, you may be deemed to have received for U.S. federal income tax purposes a taxable dividend, without the receipt
of any cash or shares of common stock. If you are a non-U.S. holder (as defined in &#8220;Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations&#8221;),
such deemed dividend may be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax (at a 30% rate, or lower treaty rate if applicable), which
may be set off against subsequent payments of cash on our preferred stock, which may be sold to fund the withholding tax obligation.

profits, as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We cannot assure you that we will have sufficient earnings and profits
in 2016 or in future years to cause all distributions on the preferred stock to be treated as dividends. If a distribution with
respect to the preferred stock fails to qualify as a dividend, corporate U.S. holders would not be eligible for the dividends-received
deduction with respect to such distribution. See &#8220;U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations.&#8221;</P>

facilities near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers and industrial sites, could increase
the level of damages resulting from these risks. These activities may subject us to litigation and administrative proceedings that
could result in substantial monetary judgments, fines or penalties. To the extent that the occurrence of any of these events is

A falling, slow or sluggish economy that would reduce the demand for natural gas in the areas in which we are doing business by

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">We are a public
utility company holding company headquartered in Corning, New York, formed as a New York corporation in 2013 to hold all of the
outstanding capital of the Gas Company and its dormant subsidiary Corning Natural Gas Appliance Corporation. The Gas Company was
incorporated in New York in 1904. Our primary business, through the Gas Company, is a regulated natural gas distribution business
with operations in New York. The Holding Company also has 50% ownership interests in Leatherstocking Gas and Leatherstocking Pipeline.
Through our 50% interest in the two Leatherstocking JVs, we have municipal franchises to provide gas in four counties in upstate
New York, distribute gas in two counties in Pennsylvania, and own pipeline, gate stations and supply gas to one company in Lawton,
Pennsylvania.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">Our principal executive
offices are located at 330 West William Street, Corning, New York 14830, and our telephone number is 607-936-3755. Our web site

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify"><B><I>Business</I></B></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">The Gas Company
purchases, transports, distributes and sells natural gas. The Gas Company has over 425 miles of gas distribution main, 15,000 services,
and 86 regulating stations. Our customer base includes residential, commercial, industrial and municipal customers in the Southern
Tier area of New York and gas utilities that service the Bath area and Elmira, New York. The Gas Company is franchised to supply
gas service in all of the political subdivisions in which it operates. The Gas Company also transports and compresses gas for a
gas producer from its gathering network into an interstate pipeline. The Gas Company is under the jurisdiction of the NYPSC, which
oversees and sets the rates for New York gas distribution companies.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">Leatherstocking
Gas distributes gas in Susquehanna and Bradford Counties, Pennsylvania, and has franchises to provide gas distribution services
in Broome, Chenango, Delaware, and Ostego Counties, New York. Leatherstocking Pipeline currently supplies gas from the Williams
Partners L.P.&#8217;s pipeline to one customer in Lawton, Pennsylvania. Leatherstocking Gas owns three gate stations and approximately
16 miles of pipeline in Susquehanna and Bradford counties, Pennsylvania.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify"><B><I>Gas Supply</I></B></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">We have contracted
with various sources to provide natural gas to our distribution system. We contract for pipeline capacity, as well as storage capacity
of approximately 736,000 dekatherms (&#8220;Dth&#8221;). Prior to 2014, the Gas Company contracted with a third party to manage
its gas supply and storage. After that date, we began to manage our transportation and storage capacity with internal resources.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">We have secured
the NYPSC-required fixed price and storage gas supply for the 2015-2016 winter season and are managing our storage and gas supply
contracts following our gas supply and acquisition plan. Assuming no extraordinary conditions for the winter season, gas supply,
transportation and storage, will be adequate to serve our 15,000 customers.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">Further, we
do not expect a shortage of natural gas to impact our business over the next five to ten years. Natural gas supply over the
last several years has been positive, and domestic reserves and production have increased. This is especially true in
proximity to our distribution network. We likewise anticipate no shortages of the necessary pipes and valves for safe
distribution of natural gas, and continue to receive material inventory from various reliable sources.</P>

seasonal because a material portion of our total sales and delivery volumes is to customers whose usage varies depending upon temperature.
Our present rate structure, however, includes weather normalization and revenue decoupling clauses, which are designed to mitigate

has four major customers, Corning Incorporated, New York State Electric &amp; Gas, Bath Electric, Gas &amp; Water Systems, and
Repsol Energy North America (&#8220;Repsol&#8221;, formerly Talisman Energy USA Incorporated). Although Repsol is a significant
customer, we do not deliver gas to it. Rather we receive gas from several of its gathering systems and wells, and transport its
gas through our system. These customers accounted for approximately 18.8% of our revenues in fiscal year 2015 and 17.7% in fiscal
year 2014. The loss of any of these customers would have an impact on our financial results.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">The Gas Company
had 58 employees as of September 30, 2015, and 57 as of September 30, 2014. Of this total, nearly half are union labor working

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">Since 2000, domestic
energy markets have experienced significant price volatility. Natural gas markets have been particularly volatile, principally
due to weather and changes in supply availability. Rising natural gas prices and the development of new technologies (specifically
hydraulic fracturing) resulted in a surge in supply-related investment that increased domestic production, and the increased supply
and reduced demand due to economic conditions and conservation efforts have led to significant declines in natural gas prices.
Historically, the competition in our residential market has been primarily from electricity for cooking, water heating and clothes
drying, and to a small degree, electricity, fuel oil and propane for heating. The price of gas remains low in comparison to that
of alternative fuels in our service territory and our competitive position in the residential, commercial and industrial markets
continues to be strong. Over 90 percent of our residential customers heat with gas. When we expand our distribution system to attract
new customers, our principal competition is oil and propane. Natural gas enjoys a price advantage over these fuels today. Given
natural gas&#8217;s clean burning attributes, we believe environmental regulations may enhance this competitive outlook.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify"><B><I>Environmental Regulation</I></B></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">We believe we are
in compliance with present federal, state and local provisions relating to the protection of the environment. We do not expect
that continued compliance with these requirements will have any material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings and
financial position. The Gas Company has no former manufactured gas plant sites (MGP) and is not a party to any environmental proceedings,
litigation or complaints.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">We intend to enhance
shareholder value through revenue growth and reduction of our operating costs. Our earnings are primarily determined by a rate
of return for the Gas Company set by the NYPSC on the investments in our facilities and equipment (<I>e.g.</I>, both rate increases
and increased load) to ensure service to our customers. Over the next several years, we intend to make significant capital investments
to ensure the safety and reliability of our gas network. Based on these capital investments, we anticipate that we will increase
our rate base. In addition, we have identified growth opportunities that we believe will contribute to our revenues, earnings and
rate base, including growth in our existing service territory and expansion into new areas. We have also identified and are developing
opportunities for increased connections with local and nearby production sources. We have obtained required tariffs from the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to transport gas from the gas producers exploiting the Marcellus shale reserves in northern
Pennsylvania. The Gas Company has entered into agreements with a producer for transport of gas in the Gas Company&#8217;s existing
pipelines from Pennsylvania to its system in New York. The completion of our compressor station and certain pipeline upgrades have
allowed us to transport additional quantities of Marcellus shale gas into an interstate pipeline.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">We also continue
to invest in our Leatherstocking JVs. Leatherstocking Gas is a gas utility in the Northern Tier of Pennsylvania and the Southern
Tier of New York. It has 270 customers, including a large industrial user, multiple school complexes and a new hospital. This 50%-owned
joint venture company plans, depending on market conditions and regulatory approvals, to add one to two new franchises for gas
supply a year.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">We have agreed,
subject to regulatory approvals and other conditions to closing, to acquire the stock of Pike County Light &amp; Power, a Pennsylvania
electric and gas utility which provides electric service to approximately 4,500 customers and natural gas service to 1,200 customers
in Pike County, Pennsylvania. We expect that the acquisition will, over time, provide additional dividends to the Holding Company.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">Our principal business
and operations are conducted through our wholly-owned subsidiary, the Gas Company. The Gas Company is subject to regulation by
the New York Public Service Commission (&#8220;NYPSC&#8221;) as a gas utility. The NYPSC regulates the rates the Gas Company may
charge its customers and its orders also include requirements for levels of customer service, and capital improvements to improve
the safety and reliability of its services, and contain parameters for sharing its revenues between its customers and its shareholder
(the Holding Company) &#8211; all of which affect the rates which the Gas Company actually charges its customers. On April 20,
2012 the NYPSC issued an order in the Gas Company&#8217;s rate case (Case 11-G-0280) approving a three-year Gas Rate Plan. The
rate plan approved by the order authorized a revenue increase of $944,310 for each of the three years beginning May 1, 2012; $899,674
for each of years two and three; and $323,591 in year three, for a cumulative revenue increase of $4,955,869 over the three year
period concluding April 30, 2015. The order provided the Gas Company with the opportunity to earn $545,284 from local production
before sharing, a 118% increase from the $250,000 allowed previously, and required the Gas Company to complete certain safety and
reliability projects to enhance its existing infrastructure.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">On October
19, 2015, the NYPSC issued an order in the Gas Company&#8217;s rate proceeding (Case 11-G-0280) which approved a joint
proposal (the &#8220;Extension Joint Proposal&#8221;) for an extension of the Gas Company&#8217;s 2012 Gas Rate Plan. The
Extension Joint Proposal, as approved, extends the term of the 2012 Gas Rate Plan for an additional two years, through April
30, 2017. Subject to certain adjustments allowed by the Extension Joint Proposal, the Gas Company&#8217;s natural gas
delivery rates to its customers, established in the 2012 Gas Rate Plan, will remain at their current levels during that
period. The Extension Joint Proposal provides for the Gas Company to establish a &#8220;Safety and Reliability Charge&#8221;
on its customers to recover certain carrying costs on approved infrastructure improvements for the period of the extension,
May 1, 2015 through April 30, 2017. The Extension Joint Proposal also resolves a property tax issue that was raised by the
NYPSC in a separate case, and requires the Gas Company to return to customers a &#8220;System Benefit Charge&#8221;
over-collection (a regulatory liability of the Gas Company) over a three-year period. In addition, the Extension Joint
Proposal adjusts the 2012 Gas Rate Plan&#8217;s Earnings Sharing Mechanism by lowering the Return on Equity
(&#8220;ROE&#8221;) threshold, from 9.5% to 9.0%, for the commencement of sharing by customers of excess earnings and by
increasing the opportunity for customer sharing at various ROE levels above that threshold.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">The Gas Company
must also seek approval of the NYPSC for its capital-raising activities, both debt and equity. Prior to the establishment of the
holding company structure, the Gas Company was authorized by the NYPSC, on May 17, 2012, to issue long term debt up to $9,000,000
and to issue common stock, convertible preferred stock and stock warrants up to $9,000,000, no later than December 31, 2016. During
the preparation of a new debt financing petition to be filed with the NYPSC, the Gas Company discovered that it had inadvertently
not filed notice to the Commission of issuance of debt on August 13, 2013 and September 3, 2013 in the amounts of $750,000 and
$2,329,223, respectively, which resulted in a total of $10,440,223 of debt issuance, exceeding the $9,000,000 authorized by the
2012 order by $1,440,223. On August 3, 2015, the Gas Company notified the NYPSC of the two additional debt issuances. The Gas Company,
on August 6, 2015, filed a petition in Case 15-G-0460 seeking authority to issue $34,768,837 in long term debt to fund its capital
expenditures for the period from 2015 to 2021. The amount requested in the petition reflects the deduction of $1,440,223, the amount
by which previous issuances exceed the authorized amount. On December 8, 2015, the Gas Company filed an amendment to the petition
to seek authorization to undertake consolidation of $17,400,000 of its existing debt with two bonds into a single six-year term
loan from one of those banks. On January&nbsp;21, 2016, the NYPSC issued its financing order which includes refinancing of $15.3
million of existing long-term debt and $13.1 million in new long-term debt. The latter amount includes refinancing of existing
short-term debt and financing of new capital expenditures and sinking fund payments. The $17.4 million consolidated loan and separate
$4.2 million loan with M&amp;T Bank, as described below were entered into on January 27, 2016 pursuant to the NYPSC Financing Order.
In its January 21, 2016 order, the NYPSC limited the authorization of new long-term debt to the amount required to address financing
needs through 2017 and the Gas Company, before filing a financing petition to address needs beyond 2017, would be required to consult
with the NYPSC Staff. For the refinancing of existing debt, the NYPSC&#8217;s authorization was granted on the condition that the
Gas Company demonstrates savings on a net present value basis or provides proof of other benefits prior to each financing.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">Leatherstocking
Gas is also required to obtain regulatory approval for certain actions. On March 24, 2014, Leatherstocking Gas filed a petition
with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (the &#8220;PAPUC&#8221;) requesting authorization to issue a commercial promissory
note in the amount of $4,000,000, which was approved on May 22, 2014. On February 20, 2015, Leatherstocking Gas filed with the
NYPSC for approval of, and permission to exercise, franchises previously granted in the Town of Windsor and Village of Windsor.
The Commission review of the applications is pending. On February 27, 2015, Leatherstocking Gas filed for authority to issue long
term indebtedness in the principal amount of $2,750,000 for the purpose of financing new construction in the Town and Village of
Windsor. The NYPSC review of the application is pending. On June 3, 2015, Leatherstocking Gas filed a petition with the PAPUC requesting

the Gas Company refinanced its outstanding loans with M&amp;T Bank, Five Star Bank and Community Bank, N.A. through a new secured
facility with M&amp;T Bank and entered into a line of credit and a multi-disbursement equipment loan with M&amp;T Bank. Substantially

entered into in connection with the loans under the Credit Agreement contain additional covenants, events of default and
remedies and other terms which are generally typical of financings of this type. The Gas Company entered into three
promissory notes under the Credit Agreement, each dated January 27, 2016: a $17,400,000 Term Note (the &#8220;Term

13, 2015, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Orange and Rockland Utilities, Inc. for our purchase of all of the
outstanding capital stock of Pike County Light &amp; Power Company, a Pennsylvania corporation. Pike County Light &amp; Power
is a regulated electric and gas utility. It provides electric service to approximately 4,600 customers in the Townships of
Westfall, Milford and the northern part of Dingman, and in the Boroughs of Milford and Matamoras and natural gas service to
1,200 customers in Westfall Township and the Borough of Matamoras, in Pike County, Pennsylvania. The purchase price for the
stock is $13.117 million, with a closing date working capital adjustment that will not increase the purchase price by more
than $3 million. As part of the purchase, the $3.2 million in bonds will be assumed, although we expect to cause those bonds
to be redeemed soon after closing of the stock purchase. The Stock Purchase Agreement contemplates that, upon closing, Orange
and Rockland will provide certain interim transition services, as well as provide gas and electricity to Pike County Light
&amp; Power for three years. Certain other relationships between Orange and Rockland and Pike County will provide ongoing
access, service and maintenance of electric circuits and a gas pipeline which will, as of closing, be owned to the edge of
the New York border with Pennsylvania in the Delaware River by Orange and Rockland and from that the edge of the Pennsylvania
border with New York, by Pike County Light &amp; Power. Closing of the transaction is contingent on regulatory approvals of,
filings with or consents by the NYPSC, the PAPUC and the Federal Regulatory Energy Commission, as well as other customary
conditions to closing. The Stock Purchase Agreement is filed as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this

company, and funds for other general corporate purposes. We did not use a specific formula or other methodology to determine
the estimated offering proceeds. A majority of the members of our Board of Directors have expressed interest in participating
in the purchase of Preferred Stock in the rights offering. They have no binding commitment to do so. In the event that less

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">Our board of directors
determined the subscription price for the shares of Series A Cumulative Stock and the shares of Series B Convertible Stock based
on the information available to the board of directors regarding our capital and other cash needs for the acquisition of Pike County
Light &amp; Power Company and the refinancing of its bonds, the Gas Company&#8217;s required capital improvements, the funding
needs of the Leatherstocking JVs for construction of gas distributions systems, for debt service and for other working capital
and general business purposes, the lack of an active trading market our common stock and other matters. Our board of directors
considered a number of factors in establishing the subscription price for each series of preferred stock, including the historic
and then current market price of our common stock, our business prospects, our recent and anticipated operating results, general
conditions in the securities markets, our need for capital, alternatives available to us for raising capital, the amount of proceeds
desired, the pricing of similar transactions, the liquidity of our common stock and the level of risk to our investors. In in considering
the terms of the Rights and the Preferred Stock and the prices at which the Rights may be exercised to purchase shares of the Series
A Cumulative Stock and the Series B Convertible Stock, the board of directors of the Holding Company did not rely on any formula
or other specific market or business data in making its determination but focused generally on terms which would provide an incentive
to current shareholders to exercise their rights without being dilutive of the outstanding common stock, and the desire to provide
an opportunity to all of the shareholders to participate in the rights offering on a pro rata basis.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">Our board of directors
makes no recommendation to you about whether you should exercise any of your subscription rights. A majority of the members of
the board of directors have expressed non-binding interest in participating in the purchase of Preferred Stock in the rights offering.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">The subscription
price does not necessarily bear any relationship to the results of our past operations, cash flows, net income, or financial condition,
the book value of our assets, or any other established criteria for value, nor does the trading history of our common stock accurately
predict its future market performance. Because of the manner in which we have established the subscription price, the trading price
of our common stock may be below the subscription price even at the closing of this rights offering.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">We did not seek
or obtain any opinion of financial advisors or investment bankers in establishing the subscription price of the offering. On March
28, 2016, the closing price for our common stock on the OTCQX<SUP>&reg;</SUP> was $15.95 per share. You should not consider the
subscription price to be an indication of our value or any assurance of future value.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">In approving the
acquisition of Pike County Light &amp; Power Company, the board of directors of the Holding Company considered the need to finance
the acquisition including not only the initial purchase price, but also carefully evaluated our need for additional capital and
financial flexibility. The board of directors also considered alternative capital raising methods that are available to us and
analyzed, among other things, the costs and expenses associated with such methods. In conducting its analysis, the board of directors
also considered the effect on the ownership percentage of the current holders of our common stock caused by the rights offering,
the pro-rata nature of a rights offering to our shareholders, the market price of our common stock, and general conditions of the
securities markets.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">After
weighing the factors discussed above and the effect of the rights offering of generating an estimated $8,000,000 in net
proceeds (after estimated expenses), as additional capital for us, we believe that the rights offering is the best
alternative to raise capital to complete the purchase of Pike County Light &amp; Power Company, and in the best interests of
the Holding Company, including the Gas Company and our Leatherstocking JVs, and our shareholders. However, our board of
directors is not making any recommendation as to whether you should exercise your subscription rights. Because we have no
commitments from shareholders to exercise their subscription rights, it is possible we will not receive any proceeds from
this offering.</P>

Subscription Rights Card</B></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">You should read
and follow the instructions accompanying the subscription rights card carefully.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">You are responsible
for the method of delivery of your subscription rights card(s) with your subscription price payment to the subscription agent.
If you send your subscription rights card(s) and subscription price payment by mail, we recommend that you send them by registered
mail, properly insured, with return receipt requested. We recommend the same for overnight deliveries. You should allow a sufficient
number of days to ensure delivery to the subscription agent prior to the time this rights offering expires. Because uncertified
personal checks may take at least five business days to clear, and even certified personal checks take some time to clear, you
are strongly urged to pay, or arrange for payment, by means of a wire transfer of funds.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify"><B>Determinations Regarding the Exercise
of Your Subscription Rights</B></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">We will decide all
questions concerning the timeliness, validity, form and eligibility of the exercise of your subscription rights and any such determinations
by us will be final and binding. We, in our sole discretion, may waive, in any particular instance, any defect or irregularity,
or permit, in any particular instance, a defect or irregularity to be corrected within such time as we may determine. We will not
be required to make uniform determinations in all cases. We may reject the exercise of any of your subscription rights because
of any defect or irregularity. We will not accept any exercise of subscription rights until all irregularities have been waived
by us or cured by you within such time as we decide, in our sole discretion.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">The subscription
agent will attempt to notify you of any defect or irregularity in connection with your submission of subscription rights cards;
however, neither we nor the subscription agent will be liable for failure to so notify you. We reserve the right to reject your
exercise of subscription rights if your exercise is not in accordance with the terms of this rights offering or in proper form.
We will also not accept the exercise of your subscription rights if our issuance of shares of our Preferred Stock to you could
be deemed unlawful under applicable law.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify"><B>Regulatory Limitations</B></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">Although the
exercise of your subscription rights to purchase either the 6% Series A Cumulative Preferred Stock or the Series B
Convertible Preferred Stock, without more, does not trigger specific limitations or disclosure requirements, if you exercise
your subscription rights to purchase Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, and if you desire to convert those shares into
common stock, you may be subject to certain limitations and disclosure requirements. Your holdings of our common stock may,
for certain regulatory purposes, be deemed ownership of the common stock of the Gas Company. Pursuant to the NY Public
Service Law and the regulations of the NYPSC, if you are deemed to indirectly own more than 1% of the Gas Company&#8217;s
common stock, your holdings may be disclosed in our reports filed with the NYPSC. If you are deemed to own more than 5% of
the Gas Company&#8217;s common stock, you may be prohibited from engaging in certain transactions with us without the
approval of the NYPSC. If you are deemed to own or, upon exercise of a conversion right will own, more than 10% of the Gas
Company&#8217;s common stock, you may require the consent of the NYPSC to acquire additional shares of common stock,
including upon conversion of our Series B Convertible Stock. A May&nbsp;17, 2012 Order issued in Case 12-G-0049 involving an
offering by the Gas Company, prior to formation of the Holding Company, may offer some guidance as to how the NYPSC would
view such conversion rights. In that Order, the NYPSC approved the acquisition of additional shares by those shareholders
holding more than 10%, provided that the additional shares were offered consistent with maintaining the proportional
ownership interests in existence at the time of the offering. While the Order is limited by its terms to the
specific offering presented in Case 12-G-0049, it suggests that where an offering provides the opportunity to shareholders to
maintain their proportional ownership interests, the NYPSC may not find it necessary to require, on an individual
transaction-by-transaction basis, advance approval for the exercise of conversion rights. The Holding Company intends to
request a determination from the NYPSC that the conversion of the shares of Class B Convertible Stock into common stock, in
proportion to existing ownership interests, either does not require separate, individual authorization or, alternatively, if
such authorization is required, that it be granted.</P>

to beneficially own that common stock for certain purposes under the federal securities laws. For example, if you own more than
5% of our common stock, you are required to make certain filings with the SEC. If you own, directly and beneficially, 10% or more
of our common stock you will be subject to certain trading restrictions by and required to make additional filings with the SEC.
Finally, if you own more than 20% of our common stock, you are prohibited from engaging in certain transactions with us without

initial issue date is June 27, 2016, will be approximately $0.385 per share (based on the annual dividend rate of 6.0% and a
liquidation preference of $25.00 per share) and will be payable, when, as and if declared, on October 14, 2016. The dividend
on the Series A Cumulative Stock for each subsequent full dividend period, when, as and if declared, will be approximately
$0.375 per share (based on the annual dividend rate of 6.0% and a liquidation preference of $25.00 per share). Accumulated
dividends will not bear interest if they are paid subsequent to the applicable Dividend Payment Date.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">Under our Charter,
as amended by the Certificate of Amendment filed with the New York Secretary of State on January&nbsp;28, 2016, our board of directors
is authorized, subject to certain limitations prescribed by law, to issue up to 360,000 shares of Series B Convertible Stock, with
such voting powers or without voting powers, and with such designations, and having such relative preferences, participating, optional
or other special rights, and qualifications, limitations and restrictions as shall be set forth in the resolutions providing therefor.
We have not previously designated any of such Series B Convertible Stock. At the consummation of this offering, if our shareholders
have properly exercised their subscription rights to purchase more than 360,000 shares of Series B Convertible Stock, we will amend
our Charter to increase the number of shares of Series B Convertible Stock authorized, and decrease the number of Series A Cumulative
Stock authorized, to provide for the issuance of the number of shares of Series B Convertible Stock as our shareholders have elected
to purchase upon exercise of their subscription rights, including any over-subscription purchases at an initial price of $20.75
per share of Series B Convertible Stock. In addition, such number of shares may be increased or decreased by resolution of the
board of directors, provided, however, that no such decrease shall reduce the number of shares of Series B Convertible Stock to
a number less than the number of shares then outstanding plus the number of shares reserved, if any, for issuance upon the exercise
of any outstanding options, rights or warrants, or upon exercise of any options, rights or warrants issuable upon conversion of
any outstanding securities issued by the Corporation convertible into Series B Convertible Stock. Series B Convertible Stock may
not be issued in fractions of a share.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">Holders of shares
of Series B Convertible Stock will be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by our board of directors, out of funds legally
available for payment, cumulative cash dividends at the rate per annum of 4.8% on the liquidation preference of $20.75 per share
of Series B Convertible Stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon the exercise of a holder of shares of Series B Convertible Stock
of their conversion rights (as described in &#8220;&#8212; Description of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock; Conversion at the
Option of the Holder&#8221;), rather than receiving a cash dividend for accumulated dividends upon conversion, the Series B Conversion
Rate will be adjusted such that the holder of Series B Convertible Stock receives additional shares of common stock equal to the
amount of accumulated but unpaid dividends divided by $20.75.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">Declared dividends
on the Series B Convertible Stock will be payable quarterly on the Dividend Payment Dates, the 14th day of April, July, October
and January of each year up to and including the Series B Mandatory Redemption Date (as defined below), commencing October&nbsp;14,
2016, at such annual rate, and dividends shall accumulate from the most recent date as to which dividends shall have been paid
or, if no dividends have been paid, from the initial issue date of the Series B Convertible Stock, whether or not in any dividend
period or periods there have been funds legally available for the payment of such dividends. Declared dividends will be payable
on the relevant Dividend Payment Date to holders of record as they appear on our stock register at 5:00&nbsp;p.m., New York City
time, on the Dividend Record Date, March&nbsp;31, June&nbsp;30, September 30 and December&nbsp;31.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">Dividends for Series
B Convertible Stock will begin to accrue and be cumulative on outstanding shares of Series&nbsp;B Convertible Stock from the date
of issuance of such shares of Series B Convertible Stock. Accrued but unpaid dividends will not bear interest. Dividends declared
and paid on the shares of Series&nbsp;B Convertible Stock in an amount less than the total amount of such dividends at the time
accrued and payable on such shares will be allocated pro rata on a share-by-share basis among all such shares at the time outstanding
and among all other series of Preferred Stock ranking on parity with the Series B Convertible Stock.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">The initial dividend
period will commence on and include the initial issue date of our Series B Convertible Stock and will end on and exclude the June&nbsp;30,
2016 Dividend Payment Date. The amount of dividends payable on each share of Series B Convertible Stock for each full dividend
period (after the initial dividend period) will be computed by dividing the annual dividend rate by four. Dividends payable on
the Series B Convertible Stock for the initial dividend period and any partial dividend period will be computed based upon the
actual number of days elapsed during the period over a 360-day year (consisting of twelve 30-day months). Accordingly, the dividend
on the Series B Convertible Stock for the first dividend period, assuming the initial issue date is June 27, 2016, will be approximately
$0.257 per share (based on the annual dividend rate of 4.8% and a liquidation preference of $20.75 per share) and will be payable,
when, as and if declared, on October 14, 2016. The dividend on the Series B Convertible Stock for each subsequent full dividend
period, when, as and if declared, will be approximately $0.253 per share (based on the annual dividend rate of 4.8% and a liquidation
preference of $20.75 per share). Accumulated dividends will not bear interest if they are paid subsequent to the applicable Dividend
Payment Date.</P>

to declare and pay cash dividends and make other distributions with respect to our capital stock, including the Series B
Convertible Stock, may be limited by the terms of any existing and future indebtedness. In addition, our ability to declare
and pay dividends may be limited by applicable New York law. Our ability to pay dividends on our Preferred Stock will be
limited as will our ability to redeem our Preferred Stock at the maturity of the Series B Convertible Stock or upon a
Fundamental Change for both series of Preferred Stock. See information under the heading &#8220;Risk Factors &#8211; Risks
Related to Ownership of Our Preferred Stock&#8221;.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">To facilitate subsequent
transfers, all securities deposited by Direct Participants with DTC are registered in the name of DTC&#8217;s partnership nominee,
Cede&amp; Co., or such other name as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. The deposit of securities with DTC
and their registration in the name of Cede &amp; Co. or other such DTC nominee do not effect any change in beneficial ownership.
DTC has no knowledge of the actual Beneficial Owners of the Series B Convertible Stock; DTC&#8217;s records reflect only the identity
of the Direct Participants to whose accounts such Series B Convertible Stock are credited, which may or may not be the Beneficial
Owners. The Direct and Indirect Participants will remain responsible for keeping account of their holdings on behalf of their customers.</P>

Cede &amp; Co. (nor any other DTC nominee) will consent or vote with respect to Series B Convertible Stock unless authorized by
a Direct Participant in accordance with DTC&#8217;s MMI Procedures. Under its usual procedures, DTC mails an Omnibus Proxy to us
as soon as possible after the record date. The Omnibus Proxy assigns Cede &amp; Co.&#8217;s consenting or voting rights to those
Direct Participants to whose accounts Series B Convertible Stock are credited on the record date (identified in a listing attached
to the Omnibus Proxy).</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">Redemption proceeds,
distributions, and dividend payments on the Preferred Stock held through DTC will be made to Cede &amp; Co., or such other nominee
as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. DTC&#8217;s practice is to credit Direct Participants&#8217; accounts
upon DTC&#8217;s receipt of funds and corresponding detail information from us, on payable date in accordance with their respective
holdings shown on DTC&#8217;s records. Payments by Direct Participants to Beneficial Owners will be governed by standing instructions
and customary practices, as is the case with securities held for the accounts of customers in bearer form or registered in &#8220;street
name&#8221; and will be the responsibility of each such Direct Participant and not of DTC or us, subject to any statutory or regulatory
requirements as may be in effect from time to time. Payment of redemption proceeds, distributions, and dividend payments to Cede
&amp; Co. (or such other nominee as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC) is our responsibility, disbursement
of such payments to Direct Participants will be the responsibility of DTC, and disbursement of such payments to the Beneficial
Owners will be the responsibility of Direct and Indirect Participants.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">The following discussion
is a summary of the material United States federal income tax consequences of the rights offering to holders of our common stock
of: (i) the receipt, sale and exercise (or expiration) of the subscription rights issued pursuant to this offering; and (ii) the
receipt, ownership and sale of Preferred Stock received upon exercise of such subscription rights. The legal conclusions with respect
to matters of U.S. federal income tax law identified in this &#8220;Summary of Material United States Federal Income Tax Consequences&#8221;
subject to the qualifications set forth herein, are the opinions of our counsel, Nixon Peabody LLP. This discussion addresses only
the federal income tax consequences to holders of common stock or Preferred Stock that hold their shares as capital assets and
does not address all of the income tax consequences that may be relevant to particular holders of shares of common stock or Preferred
Stock in light of their individual circumstances. This discussion does not address the tax consequences to holders of common stock
or Preferred Stock who are subject to special rules, including, without limitation, financial institutions, tax-exempt organizations,
insurance companies, broker-dealers, dealers in securities or foreign currencies, persons who hold their shares as or in a hedge
against currency risk, persons who hold their shares as a result of a constructive sale or as part of a conversion transaction,
holders who acquired their shares of common stock pursuant to the exercise of employee stock options or otherwise as compensation
or U.S. holders who beneficially own common stock through either a foreign financial institution (as defined in Code Section 1471(d)(4)
and the regulations thereunder) or certain non-financial foreign entities specified in Code Section 1472. In addition, this discussion
does not address the tax consequences to holders of common stock under any state, local or foreign tax laws or the alternative
minimum tax provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.</P>

effect on the date of this prospectus, all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect, and to varying interpretations,
that could result in United States federal income tax consequences different from those described below. Opinions of counsel are
not binding on the Internal Revenue Service (the &#8220;IRS&#8221;) or any court. As a result, we cannot assure you that the tax
consequences described in this discussion will not be challenged by the IRS or will be sustained by a court if challenged by the
IRS. No ruling has been or will be sought from the IRS as to the income tax consequences of the rights offering to holders of common
stock. The IRS is not bound by the opinions of counsel.</P>

Tax Basis in the Subscription Rights</I></B></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">The U.S. federal
income tax consequences of the receipt of the subscription rights in the Rights Offering will depend on whether the subscription
rights are considered part of a &#8220;disproportionate distribution&#8221; (as discussed below) within the meaning of Section
305 of the Code. Generally, the distribution of stock by a corporation to its shareholders with respect to their common stock is
not taxable to such shareholders pursuant to Section 305(a) of the Code. For such purpose, a distribution of rights to acquire
stock of that corporation constitutes a distribution of stock. However, if a distribution of stock or rights to acquire stock is
within one of several exceptions to the general rule of Section 305(a) set forth in subsection (b), the distribution may be taxable
to the shareholders of the distributing corporation as discussed below. Many of the exceptions to the general rule of Section 305(a)
set forth in subsection (b) involve preferred stock, such as the distribution of convertible preferred stock in certain circumstances
pursuant to Section 305(b)(5). Treasury regulations issued under Section 305 define preferred stock not for its preferred rights
and privileges, but its inability to participate in corporate growth to any significant extent such as the Preferred Stock.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">Section 305(b)(2)
is an exception to the general rule of Section 305(a) that applies to a &#8220;disproportionate distribution.&#8221; Pursuant to
Section 305(b)(2), a distribution of stock rights constitutes a &#8220;disproportionate distribution,&#8221; and is therefore taxable
to the recipient shareholders, if the distribution results in (i) the receipt of property by some shareholders, and (ii) an increase
in the proportionate interest of other shareholders in the assets or earnings and profits of that corporation. For this purpose,
the term &#8220;property&#8221; means money, securities and any other property, except that such term does not include stock in
the corporation making the distribution or rights to acquire such stock. There is no requirement that both elements of Section
305(b)(2) of the Code occur in the form of a distribution or series of distributions as long as the result is that some shareholders
receive cash and property and other shareholders&#8217; proportionate interests increase. Section 305(b)(5) is another an exception
to the general rule of Section 305(a) that applies to a &#8220;disproportionate distribution.&#8221; Under section 305(b)(5), a
distribution by a corporation of rights to acquire its convertible preferred stock is treated as a taxable distribution of property
unless the corporation establishes that such distribution will not result in a disproportionate distribution. The distribution
of rights to acquire convertible preferred stock is likely to result in a disproportionate distribution when both of the following
conditions exist: (i) the conversion right must be exercised within a relatively short period of time after the date of distribution
of the rights; and (ii) taking into account such factors as the dividend rate, the redemption provisions, the marketability of
the convertible stock and the conversion price, it may be anticipated that some shareholders will exercise their conversion rights
and some will not. However, where the conversion right may be exercised over a period of many years and the dividend rate is consistent
with market conditions at the time of distribution of the rights, there is no basis for predicting at what time and the extent
to which the convertible stock will be converted and it is unlikely that a disproportionate distribution will result.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">We do not believe
that the distribution of rights in the Rights Offering should constitute an increase in the proportionate interest of some shareholders
in the assets or earnings and profits of the Company for the purpose of Section 305(b)(2) based on the fact that all of our shareholders
will receive rights in the Rights Offering based upon their respective ownership of our common stock and none of our shareholders
will receive cash or property as part of the Rights Offering. Thus the Rights Offering should not constitute part of a &#8220;disproportionate
distribution,&#8221; pursuant to Section 305(b)(2) of the Code. Further, during the last 36 months, our common stock has been our
sole outstanding class of stock, we have not made any distributions of cash or other property on such stock other than regular
quarterly cash dividends, and we have not had any convertible debt outstanding. Nor do we currently intend to issue another class
of stock (other than the Preferred Stock) or convertible debt or pay any dividends other than with respect to the Preferred Stock
and regular quarterly cash dividends on our common stock. Furthermore, we do not believe that the distribution of rights in the
Rights Offering to acquire Series B convertible preferred stock should constitute part of a &#8220;disproportionate distribution&#8221;
pursuant to Section 305(b)(5) of the Code on account of the length of the conversion period, the above-market dividend rate, and
the excess of the conversion price over the current trading price of the common stock.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">The opinions above
are not binding on the IRS or any court and there can be no assurance that the IRS or a court will agree with our opinion. There
is a risk that our application of &sect;305 to the Rights Offering is incorrect as the determination under Section 305(b) depends
on the existence or non-existence of certain facts and an analysis and balancing of those facts. If the IRS successfully asserts
that your receipt of subscription rights in the Rights Offering is currently taxable pursuant to &sect;305 of the Code, the discussion
under the heading &#8220;Consequences if the Rights Offering Is Considered Part of a Disproportionate Distribution&#8221; below
describes the U.S. federal income tax consequences that will result from such a determination.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">Assuming that the
distribution is not currently taxable, a holder&#8217;s tax basis in the subscription rights will depend on the fair market value
of the subscription rights and the fair market value of our common stock at the time of the distribution.</P>

is part of a disproportionate distribution, the distribution of subscription rights to you would be taxable as a dividend to the
extent that the fair market value of the subscription rights you receive is allocable to our current and accumulated earnings and
profits for the taxable year in which the subscription rights are distributed. We cannot determine prior to the consummation of
the Rights Offering the extent to which we will have sufficient current and accumulated earnings and profits to cause any such
distribution to be treated as a dividend. Dividends received by corporate holders of our common stock are taxable at ordinary corporate
tax rates subject to any applicable dividends-received deduction. Dividends received by noncorporate holders of our common stock
are taxed under current law at the holder&#8217;s capital gain tax rate (a maximum rate of 20%, subject to the discussion below
under Tax on Net Investment Income), provided that the holder meets applicable holding period and other requirements. Any distributions
in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits will be treated as a tax-free return of basis, and any further distributions
in excess of your tax basis in our common stock will be treated as gain from the sale or exchange of our common stock. Regardless
of whether the distribution of subscription rights is treated as a dividend, as a tax-free return of basis or as gain from the
sale or exchange of our common stock, your tax basis in the subscription rights you receive will be their fair market value.</P>

the subscription rights, and the tax basis of the shares of our Preferred Stock acquired through exercise of the subscription rights
will equal the sum of the subscription price for the shares and your tax basis in the subscription rights. The holding period for

to holders of our Preferred Stock, such distributions generally will constitute dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes
to the extent paid from our current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles.
Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits will constitute a return of capital that will be applied
against and reduce (but not below zero) the holder&#8217;s adjusted tax basis in our Preferred Stock. Any remaining excess will
be treated as gain realized on the sale or other disposition of the Preferred Stock and will be treated as described under &#8220;Sale
or Other Disposition&#8221; below. Provided certain holding period requirements are met and the holder refrains from making certain
elections, dividends paid to a non-corporate U.S. holder generally will constitute &#8220;qualified dividends&#8221; that will
be subject to tax at the maximum tax rate of 20% under current law, subject to the discussion below under Tax on Net Investment
Income. That preferential rate does not apply to dividends received to the extent that the individual shareholder elects to treat
the dividends as &#8220;investment income,&#8221; which may be offset against investment expenses, and may not apply based on the
number of days for which the U.S. holder holds the Preferred Stock.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">U.S. holders generally
will not recognize gain or loss on the receipt of common stock upon the conversion of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, provided,
however, if a U.S. holder receives cash in lieu of a fractional share of stock, the holder will recognize gain or loss equal to
the difference between the cash received and that portion of such holder&#8217;s basis in the stock attributable to the fractional
share. Further, if there is a dividend arrearage on the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock at the time of conversion and the
fair market value of the common stock issued upon conversion exceeds the issue price of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock,
the common stock received in respect of such dividend arrearage may be treated as a dividend distribution as described above under
&#8220;Distributions on Preferred Stock.&#8221; In addition, if the conversion is pursuant to a plan to periodically increase your
proportionate interest in our assets or earnings and profits, a portion of the common stock received may be treated as a dividend
distribution as described above under &#8220;Distributions on Preferred Stock.&#8221; Assuming the conversion is not pursuant to
any such plan and no dividend arrearage exists, your tax basis in the common stock received upon conversion will equal your tax
basis in the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock so converted. The holding period of the common stock received upon conversion
generally will include the period during which the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock so converted was held prior to conversion.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify"><B><I>Adjustment of the Conversion Price</I></B></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">Under Treasury Regulations
promulgated under Section 305 of the Code, an adjustment to the conversion price of convertible preferred stock generally results
in a constructive stock distribution (includable in income in the manner described above under &#8220;Distributions on Preferred
Stock&#8221;) with respect to such preferred stock to the extent such adjustment increases the proportionate interest of the holders
of such stock in the issuer&#8217;s earnings and profits. For example, an increase in the conversion ratio to reflect a taxable
dividend to holders of common stock generally will give rise to a deemed taxable dividend to the holders of preferred stock to
the extent of the issuer&#8217;s current or accumulated earnings and profits. However, adjustments to the conversion price made
pursuant to a bona fide, reasonable adjustment formula that has the effect of preventing dilution in the interest of a holder of
the preferred stock generally will not be considered to result in a constructive distribution. The conversion price of the Series
B Convertible Preferred Stock is subject to adjustment under certain circumstances (see &#8220;Anti-Dilution Adjustments&#8221;
under &#8220;Description of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock&#8221;). Such circumstances generally will constitute bona fide,
reasonable anti-dilution provisions and generally will not result in constructive distributions so long as they are not made to
compensate holders of our common stock for certain taxable distributions with respect to our common stock. However, a failure to
make an adjustment to the conversion price of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock to reflect a stock dividend or similar event
that increases that proportionate interest of the holders of our common stock could in some circumstances give rise to constructive
distributions to such holders. Accordingly, under certain circumstances, you may recognize income in the event of a constructive
distribution even though you may not receive any additional shares, cash or property.</P>

than a conversion into common stock) as capital gain or loss. Any such capital gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss
if the holder&#8217;s holding period for the disposed of Preferred Stock exceeds one year. A reduced tax rate on capital gain generally

holder will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between (1) the sum of the amount of cash and the fair
market value of any property received in such disposition and (2) the holder&#8217;s adjusted tax basis in the disposed of Preferred
Stock. A holder&#8217;s adjusted tax basis in its Preferred Stock generally will equal the holder&#8217;s acquisition cost (as
discussed above) less any prior distributions treated as a return of capital, as described above. Such gain may be subject to the
tax on net investment income under Section 1411 of the Code, discussed below.</P>

the Code imposes a 3.8% net investment tax on certain net investment income earned by individuals, estates and trusts. For these
purposes, net investment income generally includes dividends received and gain recognized with respect to our common stock or Preferred
Stock. In the case of an individual, the tax will be imposed on the lesser of (i) the shareholder&#8217;s net investment income
or (ii) the amount by which the shareholder&#8217;s modified adjusted gross income exceeds $250,000 (if the shareholder is married
and filing jointly or a surviving spouse), $125,000 (if the shareholder is married and filing separately) or $200,000 (in any other
case). In the case of an estate or trust, the tax will be imposed on the lesser of (i) undistributed net investment income, or
(ii) the excess adjusted gross income over the dollar amount at which the highest income tax bracket applicable to an estate or
trust begins. Holders of our common stock or Preferred Stock should consult their own tax advisors regarding the implications of
this additional tax to their particular circumstances.</P>

to withhold a portion of payments to you under Section 3406 of the Code (&#8220;Backup withholding&#8221;). Backup withholding,
currently at a rate of 28%, generally will not apply to payments of dividends to a holder of our common stock provided the holder
furnishes to us or our paying agent the required certification as to its status. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Taxpayors
may use amounts withheld as a credit against their U.S. federal income tax liability or may claim a refund if they timely provide

a non-U.S. holder (including, in certain cases of non-U.S. holders that are entities, the owner or owners of such entities) will
be required to satisfy certain certification requirements in order to claim a reduced rate of withholding pursuant to an applicable

the second bullet point above will be subject to a 30% U.S. federal income tax (or lower applicable treaty rate) on the gain derived
from the sale, which may be offset by certain U.S.-source capital losses. We believe we currently are not a USRPHC.</P>

Preferred Stock into Common Stock</I></B></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">You generally will
not recognize any gain or loss by reason of receiving common stock in exchange for Series B Convertible Preferred Stock upon conversion
of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, except gain or loss will be recognized with respect to any cash received in lieu of
fractional shares. It is possible that dividend income may be recognized with respect to any common stock treated as received in
respect of a plan to periodically increase your interest or any dividend arrearage. See the discussion above applicable to U.S.
holders. In such case, any withholding tax on stock treated as a dividend may be satisfied by the withholding agent through a sale
of a portion of the shares you receive as a dividend or may be withheld from cash dividends, shares of our common stock or sale
proceeds subsequently paid or credited to you.</P>

conversion price (or failures to adjust the conversion price) that result in an increase in the proportionate interest of a non-U.S.
holder in our earnings and profits could result in deemed distributions to the non-U.S. holder that are taxed as described under
&#8220;Distributions on Preferred Stock.&#8221; See the discussion above applicable to U.S. Holders. It is possible that any withholding
tax on such a deemed distribution might be satisfied by the withholding agent through a sale of a portion of the shares you receive

Withholding</I></B></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">Payment of dividends
(including constructive dividends), and the tax withheld with respect thereto, is subject to information reporting requirements.
These information reporting requirements apply regardless of whether withholding was reduced or eliminated by an applicable tax
treaty or withholding was not required because the dividends were effectively connected with a trade or business in the United
States conducted by the non-U.S. holder. Copies of the information returns reporting such dividends and withholding may also be
made available under the provisions of an applicable tax treaty or agreement with the tax authorities in the country in which the
non-U.S. holder resides. U.S. backup withholding will generally apply to the payment of dividends to non-U.S. holders unless such
non-U.S. holders furnish to the payor a Form W-8BEN (or other applicable form) or otherwise establish an exemption.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">Payment by a U.S.
office of a broker of the proceeds of a sale of our Preferred Stock is subject to both backup withholding and information reporting
unless the non-U.S. holder, or beneficial owner thereof, as applicable, certifies that it is a non-U.S. holder on Form W-8BEN,
or otherwise establishes an exemption. Subject to certain exceptions, backup withholding and information reporting generally will
not apply to a payment of proceeds from the sale of our convertible preferred stock or common stock if such sale is effected through
a foreign office of a broker, provided that the broker does not have certain U.S. connections.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">Any amount withheld
under the backup withholding rules from a payment to a non-U.S. holder is allowable as a credit against such holder&#8217;s U.S.
federal income tax liability, which may entitle the holder to a refund if such withheld amount is in excess of such liability,
provided that the holder timely provides the required information to the IRS. Non-U.S. holders are urged to consult their own tax
advisers regarding the application of backup withholding in their particular circumstances and the availability of and procedure
for obtaining an exemption from backup withholding under current Treasury Regulations.</P>

Act</I></B></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">Sections 1471 through
1474 of the Code, and the Treasury Regulations and administrative guidance promulgated thereunder (&#8220;FATCA&#8221;) impose
U.S. withholding on certain payments made to &#8220;foreign financial institutions&#8221; and to certain other non-U.S. entities,
including intermediaries. Such withholding will generally be imposed at a 30% rate on certain payments of dividends on, or gross
proceeds from the sale or disposition of, shares issued by a U.S. person, including the Preferred Stock, to a foreign financial
institution unless such foreign financial institution enters into (or is deemed to have entered into) an agreement with the U.S.
Treasury to, among other things, undertake to identify accounts held by certain U.S. persons or U.S.-owned foreign entities, annually
report certain information about such accounts, and withhold 30% of payments to such account holders whose actions prevent the
financial institution from complying with these reporting and other requirements. Withholding is imposed on similar types of payments
to a non-financial foreign entity unless the entity certifies that it does not have any substantial U.S. owners or the entity furnishes
identifying information regarding each substantial U.S. owner. FATCA withholding is scheduled to apply to payments from the disposition
of property producing such payments after December 31, 2018. Non-U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisers with respect
to the U.S. federal income tax consequences of FATCA to their ownership and disposition of convertible preferred stock or common
stock.</P>

&#8220;Prospectus&#8221;). Record holders of Common Stock at the close of business on April 14, 2016 (the &#8220;Record Date&#8221;),
are receiving non-transferable subscription rights (the &#8220;Rights&#8221;) to subscribe for a collectively, the &#8220;Basic
Subscription Privilege&#8221;): (i) one-eighth share of our 6% Series A Cumulative Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (&#8220;Series
A Cumulative Stock&#8221;), for $25.00 per share (the &#8220;Series A Subscription Price&#8221;), or (ii) one-sixth share of our

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">The Rights will
expire, if not exercised, at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on June 20, 2016, unless extended in the sole discretion of the Holding
Company (as it may be extended, the &#8220;Expiration Date&#8221;). If the Holding Company extends the time for exercising the
Rights, it will not extend such time more than 30 days past the original expiration date. After the Expiration Date, unexercised
Rights will be null and void. The Holding Company will not be obligated to honor any purported exercise of Rights received by Computershare
Trust Company, N.A. (the &#8220;Subscription Agent&#8221;), after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Expiration Date, regardless
of when the documents relating to such exercise were sent. The Holding Company may extend the Expiration Date by giving oral or
written notice to the Subscription Agent on or before the Expiration Date, followed by a press release no later than 9:00 a.m.,
New York City time, on the next business day after the previously scheduled Expiration Date. The Rights will be evidenced by non-transferable

series of Preferred Stock not purchased by Holders exercising their Basic Subscription Rights (the &#8220;<U>Excess Shares</U>&#8221;),
subject to availability and pro ration as described below. Each holder of Rights may only exercise their Over-Subscription Privilege
if they exercised their Basic Subscription Privilege in full and other holders of Rights do not exercise their Basic Subscription
Privilege in full. If there are not enough Excess Shares to satisfy all subscriptions made under the Over-Subscription Privilege,
the Holding Company will allocate the remaining Excess Shares pro rata among those holders of Rights who exercised their Over-Subscription
Privileges. &#8220;<U>Pro rata</U>&#8221; means in proportion to the number of Shares of a series of Preferred Stock for which
such holder of Rights has exercised the Over-Subscription Privilege to the total number of Shares of such series for which all
holders have exercised the Over-Subscription Privilege, multiplied by the number of Excess Shares of such series of Preferred Stock.

and Officers.</B></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">The NYBCL permits
a corporation to indemnify its current and former directors and officers against expenses, judgments, fines and amounts paid in
connection with a legal proceeding. To be indemnified, the person must have acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably
believed to be in, and not opposed to, the best interests of the corporation. With respect to any criminal action or proceeding,
the person must not have had reasonable cause to believe the conduct was unlawful.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">The NYBCL permits
a present or former director or officer of a corporation to be indemnified against certain expenses if the person has been successful,
on the merit or otherwise, in defense of any proceeding brought against such person by virtue of the fact that the person is or
was an officer or director of the corporation. In addition, the NYBCL permits the advancement of expenses relating to the defense
of any proceeding to directors and officers contingent upon the person&#8217;s commitment to repay advances for expenses in the
case he or she is ultimately found not to be entitled to be indemnified.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">The NYBCL provides
that the indemnification provisions contained in the NYBCL are not exclusive of any other right that a person seeking indemnification
may have or later acquire under any provision of a corporation&#8217;s certification of incorporation or by-laws, or, when authorized
by the corporation&#8217;s card of incorporation or by-laws, by any agreement, by any vote of shareholders or disinterested directors
or otherwise. The NYBCL also provides that a corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect its directors and officers
in instances in which they may not otherwise be indemnified by the corporation under the provisions of the NYBCL provided the contract
of insurance covering the directors and officers provides, in a manner acceptable to the New York superintendent of insurance,
for a retention amount and for co-insurance.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">Insofar as indemnification
for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the
registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities
and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable.
In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred
or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding)
is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant
will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate
jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed
by the final adjudication of such issue.</P>

of the subscription offer, the transactions by any underwriters during the subscription period, the amount of unsubscribed securities
to be purchased by any underwriters, and the terms of any subsequent reoffering thereof. If any public offering by any underwriters
is to be made on terms differing from those set forth on the cover page of the prospectus, a post-effective amendment will be filed
to set forth the terms of such offering.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 10pt; text-indent: 0.5in">We have acted as counsel to Corning Natural
Gas Holding Corporation, a New York corporation (the &#8220;Holding Company&#8221;), in connection with the issuance of 2,469,871
non-transferable subscription rights (the &#8220;Rights&#8221;) to be distributed by the Holding Company without consideration
in connection with a rights offering (the &#8220;Rights Offering&#8221;) to the holders of record of its common stock, par value
$0.01 per share (the &#8220;Common Stock&#8221;). Each Right entitles the holder to purchase either: (i) one-eighth share of our
6% Series A Cumulative Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (&#8220;Series A Cumulative Stock&#8221;), for $25.00 per share;
or (ii) one-sixth share of our 4.8% Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $.01 per share share (&#8220;Series B Convertible
Stock&#8221;). The Holding Company has filed a Registration Statement on Form S-1, No. 333-208943 (the &#8220;Registration Statement&#8221;)
with the Securities and Exchange Commission with respect to the issuance of the Rights, the Series A Cumulative Stock, the Series
B Convertible Stock and the Common Stock into which the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock may be converted, as described in
the prospectus forming a portion of the Registration Statement (the &#8220;Prospectus&#8221;).</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 10pt; text-indent: 0.5in">In connection with the foregoing, we
have examined: (i) the Registration Statement, (ii) the Prospectus, (iii)&nbsp;the Certificate of Incorporation and the Certificate
of Amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation of the Holding Company, (iv) the Bylaws of the Holding Company, (v) resolutions
of the Board of Directors of the Holding Company authorizing, among other things, the designation of the Series A Cumulative Stock
and the Series Convertible Stock, the issuance of the Rights, the offer and sale of the Series A Cumulative Stock and the Series
B Convertible Stock upon exercise of the Rights in accordance with their terms and the issuance of the Common Stock upon exercise
of the conversion rights of the Series B Convertible Stock in accordance with its terms, and the transactions contemplated by the
Prospectus. We also have examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of such corporate
records, certificates, and other documents and have made such investigations of law as we have deemed necessary or appropriate
as a basis for the opinions expressed below.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 10pt; text-indent: 0.5in">As to questions of fact material to our
opinions expressed herein, when relevant facts were not independently established, we have relied upon certificates of, and information
received from, officers of the Holding Company. We have made no independent investigation of the facts stated in such certificates

have relied, without investigation, upon certificates and other documents from public officials.</P>

we have assumed, without investigation, the authenticity of any document or other instrument submitted to us as an original, the
conformity to the originals of any document or other instrument submitted to us as a copy, the genuineness of all signatures on
such originals or copies, and the legal capacity of natural persons who executed any such document or instrument at the time of

and the expiration date for such Rights, (iii) the distribution of the Rights and their exercise in accordance with their terms,
and (iv) the filing of any amendment to the Certificate of Amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation with the Department of
State of the State of New York necessary to increase or decrease the number of shares authorized as Series A Cumulative Stock or
